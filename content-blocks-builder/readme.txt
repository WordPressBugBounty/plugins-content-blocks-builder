Group core blocks into containers or repeaters to create layouts like grid, carousel, popup, accordion — all in the Block Editor. Fast. Easy. Bloat-free.

== Description ==

Content Blocks Builder (CBB) helps you create **custom blocks**, **variations**, **styles**, and **patterns** — directly in the **Block Editor** without touching a **code editor**.

The WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) is a solid foundation for building websites. But when you need more specific layouts or custom functionality not available in default blocks, you're often forced to write custom code or rely on bloated third-party plugins.

CBB solves this by letting you visually group core or third-party blocks into flexible container blocks — right inside the native Block Editor. These container blocks support native features like typography, spacing, colors, borders, plus advanced features from CBB that help you build layouts like **responsive grid**, **slider/carousel**, **toggle/accordion**, **modal/off-canvas/popover**, **background effects** all without writing a single line of code.

You can also build repeater blocks to display repeatable content — similar to ACF repeater field type, but entirely block-based and visual.

[👉 Read the detailed guide to CBB blocks](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/documentation/custom-blocks/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB+Blocks).

The ultimate goal of CBB is to help you build complex layouts — all with core blocks, all visually, and fully compatible with any Gutenberg-ready theme.
**No React. No PHP. No lock-in. No clutter. No bloat. Developer-friendly.**

=== Key technical features ===

 - **Manage custom blocks**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom blocks.
 - **Create repeater blocks** that work similarly to ACF repeater fields. Supports carousel, grid, accordion and vertical stack layouts.
 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Extenral CSS/JS and Custom CSS/JS**: You can enqueue external CSS or JavaScript files and write your own custom code directly for your blocks. This feature makes CBB feel a bit like **[CodePen.io](https://codepen.io)**—but for Gutenberg blocks. You can create anything you can imagine on the frontend.
 - **Advanced block support features**: Modal, off-canvas, popover, toggle content, sticky, responsive dimensions, spacing, custom attributes, reveal animations, etc.
 - **Manage block variations & block styles**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete block variations. It works on any block. **[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** enables you to input custom CSS for variations.
 - **Manage block patterns**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom block patterns.
 - **Enhance the Query Loop block**: Add grid, carousel layouts, and advanced filter and sorting settings. Works with any post types.
 - **Import/export** custom blocks, variations, and patterns from/to other sites
 - **Pre-built library**: A library of pre-built blocks, variations, styles, and patterns. This library is not bundled with CBB; only items you import appear on your site.
 - CBB are built with vanilla JS and CSS. It only depends on [SwiperJs](https://swiperjs.com/) for the carousel functionality, — and even then, the script and styles are loaded only if the carousel layout is used.

=== Practical features you can build with CBB ===

 - **Carousel layouts**: Ideal for creating banner slider, posts carousel, gallery, carousel of features or other repeating content, etc. CBB provides one of the best way to create a carousel layout in Gutenberg. Built on top of the popular SwiperJs carousel script, it supports extensive customization. **[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** enables you to create entrance effects, advanced slide effects with effect builder, and further customization like slides per breakpoint, pagination, navigation, and synced carousels.
 - **Responsive grid layouts**: Perfect for creating equal column grid, mosaic grid, bento grid, posts grid, grid of features or other repeating content, etc. CBB provides the easiest but most flexible and robost grid layout based on CSS Grid layout. You can customize template columns, grid gaps, size, and location for each grid item.
 - **Accordion layouts**: Good for creating FAQ page, navigations, long features or specications.
 - **Blog page design, magazine layout, post grid, post carousel**; Work with any post types.
 - **Modal, off-canvas, popover, toggle content**: Great for creating popups, notification bars, toggle menu, toggle search box, hamburger menu, popover, show/hide content, etc. **[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** allows you to add a custom entrance animation effect, control when popups appear with delay options, trigger them on scroll to elements or exit intent, and remember when a popup has been closed.
 - **Sticky content**: Great for fixed/sticky header, footer, floating elements, sticky sidebar. **[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** enables you to style blocks based on their stuck state and make blocks sticky only when scrolling up.
 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Backgound effect**: Add parallax, infinite scrolling, and zooming effect to image easily. Perfect for hero section designs.
 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Reveal animations**: Add stunning effects to blocks when they appear on the viewport the first time.
 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Custom layout & style**: With the ability to enqueue external JS/CSS and input custom JS/CSS, you can do anything with your blocks on frontend.

For dynamic data, we recommend using the **[Meta Field Block](https://metafieldblock.com)** plugin. It's the best way to display dynamic data.

=== Why choose CBB? ===

 - It's **fast**, **clean**, **flexible** and **code-free**. It **uses core blocks** to build container blocks.
 - It's **bloat-free**. It doesn’t come bundled with a ton of specific-use blocks like other multiple-feature plugins.
 - It's **easy to use**. It **adheres to Gutenberg** and maintain the primary user experience of Gutenberg, so anyone familiar with the Block Editor is already familiar with CBB.
 - Sites built with CBB are **easier to maintain** as most tasks are accomplished through the Block Editor. You don't need to know React to create complex blocks or maintain a code repository for them. You can also import/export them from/to other sites.

=== Which theme should I use with this plugin? ===
It is compatible with all Gutenberg-ready themes, but our recommended themes are default themes such as [Twenty Twenty Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/), [Twenty Twenty Five](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfive/), [Twenty Twenty Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/), [Twenty Twenty Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/), or [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/) theme.

=== How does it work with other blocks/plugins? ===
This plugin works with all third-party blocks but we recommend using single-block plugins for lightweight and performance. We also develop several single block plugins, that work great with this plugin, please see them in the below section.

=== Design library ===

We have already included a library of block patterns for you to quickly use or customize to fit your design. There is a popup inserter in the block editor for you to find and insert patterns with a few clicks.

[How to use the pattern inserter popup](https://youtu.be/UTrZSBvkzj0).

Browse the **[Design Library](https://boldpatterns.net?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** to see what the plugin can do for you.

=== Block and Variation library ===

Besides the pattern library, we have built an external library of content blocks and common block variations. All of the blocks/variations in this library have been created by CBB directly in the Block Editor. With a few clicks, you can easily import blocks or variations into your site. You use them directly or customize or learn from them.

Watch some video tutorials to learn how to use the library:

= Is there a built-in design library? =

Yes, there is a library of production-ready block patterns.
